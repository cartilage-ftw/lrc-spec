## Potential with Ru II isotopes

Ruthenium also has a favourable energy level scheme and several stable isotopes. Once again it is produced by neutron capture processes, and atomic data on it is scarce. In the study of the R-process Alliance Roederer et al. (2022), they found a high overabundance of Ru in the metal-poor star they studied. This could make Ru a good tracer of neutron-capture processes.
