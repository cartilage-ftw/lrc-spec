wtf haha

lol

```bash
Saturation intensity for state with lifetime 8e-08
is  60.13706159787587 Watt per m^2 per s
For a spot area of 2 squared mm, this corresponds to a power of 120.27412319575173 microWatts
And for 80 pulses of 8 ns each
1.2027412319575172e-05 nJ is needed
When providing 1nJ, we can expect a linewidth of
3.0583965055889717 GHz
