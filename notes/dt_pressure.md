# Influence of Drift Tube Pressure on the Metastable Population

Laser Freq: 8 kHz
Bunching Freq: 200 Hz

All of these used the same laser spot size, intensity, and buncher frequency. For most of these, two scans were recorded (and hence two intensities have been reported for each line). This also gives an estimate of the degree of fluctuation.

### Variation in the Fraction of Metastable Population

| Press. DT [mbar] | Press. Buncher | Line 1 | Line 2 | Line 3 | Ratio | Dispersion | Percent Deviation from Racah | Comments |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| $1.92$ | $4.12 \times 10^{-2}$ | $12.66$, $12.65$ | $13.39$, $14.95$ | $19.55$, $19.33$ |  |  |  | The second spectrum is much cleaner |
| $1.10$ | $3.2\times 10^{-2}$ | $12.86$, $13.78$, | $15.09$, $15.23$ | $20.20$, $22.08$ |  |  |  |  |
| $0.67$ | $2.76\times 10^{-2}$ | $11.8$,  $9.24$ | $14.22$, $10.18$ | $19.33$, $15.10$ |  |  |  |  |
| **$0.21$ | **$2.03 \times 10^{-2}$ | $14.05$, $11.58$ | $15.36$, $12.5$ | $21.1$, $19.92$ |  |  |  |  |
| $0.15$ | $2.24 \times 10^{-2}$ | $9.64$ | $12.65$ | $15.41$ |  |  |  |  |

The spectra for the entry marked with ** were collected on Dec 22, and the rest on Dec 21. If laser power differences are relevant, they should not be ignored before comparing.

The the drift tube pressure seems to be important in the detection of ions themselves. By decreasing the pressure, the count rate also went down.
