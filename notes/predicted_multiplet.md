## Prediction of hyperfine multiplet
As it shall appear in experimental spectra
The line profiles are assumed to be Voigt, with a Gaussian $\sigma = 2.59$ GHz, taken to be the same as our Lu-175 measurements

### Choosing energy region to plot in

Assume the energy splitting is $\Delta E = 3066.604$ MHz (3.066 GHz). A Gaussian should be evaluated at least within 3 or 4 sigma. We choose $\mu=3.066$ GHz and evaluate the line profile prediction in the $\mu \pm 4\sigma$ range for each component in the multiplet.
